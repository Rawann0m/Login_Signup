# Login_Signup
SwiftUI Login and Signup Screens with MVVM Pattern
## Description
This project demonstrates how to implement login and signup screens using SwiftUI while following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It includes functionality for user authentication, with the ability to switch between login and signup views. The app also features smooth animations, button interactions, and stylish UI components, including password visibility toggles with an eye icon.

## Features:
Login and signup functionality with smooth transitions.
MVVM architecture for proper separation of concerns.
Eye icon for password visibility toggle.
Clean and responsive UI with rounded corners, padding, and spacing.
Customizable links for Google, Facebook, and Apple icons.
Animations and button interactions for a polished user experience.

## Project Structure
Views: Contains SwiftUI views for the login/signup screens, including buttons, text fields, and icons.
ViewModels: Manages user authentication logic and state using ObservableObject.
Models: Defines data models like User for managing the user's email name and password.

## Technologies Used
SwiftUI: User interface framework for declarative UI.
MVVM Architecture: Separation of concerns into Models, Views, and ViewModels.
Swift: The programming language used for this project.

## Getting Started
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run the project on a simulator or device.

## How It Works
Login and Signup Screens
The app displays either the login screen or the signup screen.
The user can toggle between login and signup modes by pressing a button that switches the view.
Password visibility can be toggled using the eye icon inside the password input field.

## Custom Links for Google, Facebook, and Apple
Each social media button (Google, Facebook, Apple) has a link attached that opens the corresponding website when tapped.
